# Website2
### This is a website to exhibit my photo portfolio.  
Version 2 was evolved from Version 1, which was created using GreenGreek, to a workflow using GitHub Pages, LocalWP, and Simply Static.  
Due to capability and other issues, this version can no longer be updated.  
This version will hold the "www.RM6401.com" domain, until replacement version can be deployed to replace it.
